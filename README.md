# E-commerce-Customer-Segmentation
# Description
Analysis of an E-Commerce customer database that lists purchases made by over 4000 customers over a period of one year, I developed a model that allows to anticipate the purchases that will be made by a new customer, during the following year, from its first purchase.

# Install
This project requires Python 3.7 and the following Python libraries installed:

- Numpy
- Pandas
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn

You will also need to have the software installed to run and execute a Jupyter Notebook

If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the Anaconda distribution of Python, which already has the above packages and more included. Make sure that you select the Python 3.7 installer and not the Python 2.x installer.

# Data
The customer segments data is included as a selection of app. 4000 data points collected on data found from an E-Commerce database, which was gotton from UCI Machine Learning Repository. You use this data in your local machine, you have to clone and unzip the data.csv file from this Repo.

# Conclusion:
This project analyzed an E-commerce customer database and developed a classification model to predict a new customer's future purchases based on their first transaction. By categorizing products into five main groups and segmenting customers into 11 categories based on purchasing behavior, the model achieved a 75% accuracy in classifying customers correctly. However, factors like seasonality and limited data duration may affect the model's performance. Expanding the dataset over a longer period could improve predictive accuracy.
